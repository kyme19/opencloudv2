## Some Terrible Weather App I made using React TS + open - mateo API

if you wanna run this install 

### intall tailwind first
```javascript
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
```

### Create a Tailwind config file:
``` javascript 
npx tailwindcss init -p
```
but since you are just lazy like it's already there there no need for that 

### Lastly Install necessary dependencies:
```javscript
npm install lucide-react
```
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.
